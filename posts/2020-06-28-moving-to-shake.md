title: Writing a Static Site Generator in Shake

Today I'm working on porting [nippo](https://github.com/mt-caret/nippo/) to
[Shake](https://shakebuild.com/).
Track my progress here: [mt-caret/suimin](https://github.com/mt-caret/suimin)

Pandoc's template language is simple enough that it's relatively
straightforward to implement what you want. I like it.
